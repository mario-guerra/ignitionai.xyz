# Azure SDK Copilot: AI-Powered Developer Assistant

## Description

The Azure SDK Copilot is an intelligent Visual Studio Code extension that revolutionizes how developers interact with Azure SDK documentation. This proof-of-concept project implements a sophisticated chat-based interface that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextual, accurate answers about Azure SDKs across five programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET, and Rust).

Unlike traditional documentation searches, this system understands natural language queries and provides precise, context-aware responses by intelligently querying a vector database populated with the latest Azure SDK documentation. The solution bridges the gap between developers and documentation, transforming static resources into an interactive, conversational experience.

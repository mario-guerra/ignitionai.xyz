# Client Acquisition Funnel — Guerrilla, Low-cost, Professional

Purpose: a compact, actionable client acquisition playbook for IgnitionAI that prioritizes low cash spend, high trust signals, and repeatable outreach.

Checklist (requirements)
- Produce a guerrilla-style, low-cost client acquisition strategy. ✅ Done
- Keep tone professional and trust-building. ✅ Done
- Provide templates (LinkedIn, email, audit landing copy, onboarding). ✅ Done
- Place new content in `bizplans` directory. ✅ Done

High-level plan
1. Target a tight niche vertical (pick 1–2 to start).
2. Build a trust-first funnel that converts awareness → audit → paid project.
3. Use repeatable, low-cost channels: LinkedIn, community posts, referrals, micro-workshops, and hyper-targeted outreach.
4. Measure a few KPIs and iterate weekly.

Funnel overview (simple)
- Awareness: LinkedIn posts, targeted connections, community answers, guest posts.
- Interest: Personalized message + free 30-minute audit offer, short Loom demo, one-page case study.
- Evaluation: 30-minute audit → short written findings + one clear recommended project (price range).
- Decision: Proposal + simple contract + scheduling.
- Onboarding: 1-week kickoff checklist, scoped milestones, small first deliverable.

Niche selection (do this first)
- Pick 1 vertical you already have portfolio points for (e.g., logistics, healthcare, e-commerce).
- Pick geography small enough to search for businesses (e.g., "San Diego logistics companies" or "NYC private practices").
Why: narrows messaging, improves outreach success, lowers lead cost.

Guerrilla, low-cost tactics (prioritized)
1. LinkedIn micro-targeting (0$)
   - Daily: 1 high-value post (case result, short checklist, or demo GIF). Use a branded image (Canva free).
   - Connect with 10 targeted people/day (founders, operations managers) with a one-line note.
   - Follow-up sequence: connection note → value DM (audit offer) → one follow-up after 4–6 days.
2. Free 30-minute Audit (lead magnet)
   - Spend 30–60 minutes on audit call. Send a <2-page> findings PDF with 2–3 recommended quick wins and an estimate.
   - Always include concrete ROI projection (time saved, cost avoided). Numbers sell trust.
3. Micro-workshops (low friction)
   - Host 45-minute free online workshop aimed at the niche. Use Eventbrite/Meetup or partner with a chamber of commerce.
   - Use the workshop to capture emails and schedule audits.
4. Testimonials & case one-pager (credibility)
   - Create 1-page PDFs for each portfolio project (problem, approach, outcome, client quote if possible). Use for LinkedIn posts, emails, and proposal attachments.
5. Community engagement (0$)
   - Answer questions in niche Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups, and relevant subreddits.
   - Don’t sell; share a short value tip + invitation to audit.
6. Local partnerships & referrals (low cost)
   - Partner with web devs, marketing agencies, or accountants who can refer clients. Offer a referral fee or reciprocal lead intro.
7. Cold email (manual, low-volume)
   - Targeted, highly personalized 5–7 email sequence to warm prospects. Keep volume low (10–20/week) to stay compliant and personal.
8. Demo videos & Looms (cheap credibility)
   - Record 1–2 minute demo videos addressing the prospect's likely pain. Attach to outreach.
9. Small paid test (optional)
   - If you must spend, run $50–$200 hyper-targeted LinkedIn posts boosting to a narrowly defined audience. Measure leads.

Messaging & templates (short, copy-ready)
- LinkedIn connection note (initial):
  Hi [Name], I help [role] at [vertical] cut time spent on [task] by 50–90% using small, practical AI tools — keen to connect.

- LinkedIn follow-up DM (after connect):
  Thanks for connecting, [Name]. I offer a short, free 30-minute AI audit where I map 1–3 quick wins for [company]. Interested? I’ll send a short checklist first.

- Cold email (initial):
  Subject: Quick idea to cut [relevant task] at [Company]

  Hi [Name],

  I help [Company type] reduce [pain] (e.g., manual booking, multilingual support) with compact AI automations. I reviewed your site and noticed [one specific observation]. If you’re open, I can run a 30-minute free audit and send 3 quick, actionable fixes you could implement in 1–2 weeks.

Audit structure (30-minute call → deliverable)
- Pre-call: short form (company, main pain, number of employees, monthly volume for target task).
- Call (30 min): 10 min intro, 10 min system walkthrough, 10 min proposed opportunities.
- Post-call: 1–2 page Findings PDF with 3 prioritized quick wins and one recommended pilot + price range.
- Follow-up: 3-day check-in email and 7-day proposal.

Qualification checklist (quick filter)
- Does the prospect have a recurring task we can automate? (yes/no)
- Is there measurable volume (calls/emails/orders)? (>=10/week recommended)
- Budget range realistic? ($5K–$20K projects ideal)
- Decision timeframe (<3 months ideal)

Proposal & pricing guidance
- Anchor with a small pilot: $3k–7k fixed-scope pilot delivering 1 high-impact automation.
- Clear deliverables, timeline (4–6 weeks), and a single success metric (time saved, % reduction).
- Keep contracts short (1–2 pages) and include a 30-day satisfaction checkpoint.

Onboarding checklist (first project)
1. Kickoff call (1 hour) — agree success metric and access list.
2. Deliver access & data checklist from client.
3. Week 1: discovery + prototype plan.
4. Week 3–4: demo of MVP + feedback.
5. Final delivery + handoff docs + 30-day support window.

Simple KPI dashboard (track weekly)
- Leads by channel (LinkedIn, referrals, cold email, workshops)
- Connected conversations started (convos)
- Audits booked
- Audits completed → proposals sent
- Proposals won (conversion) and avg. project value
- CAC estimate: total spend / closed clients (keep low)

Edge cases & risk controls
- Low response: refine niche messaging and use stronger social proof (case one-pager).
- Too many low-value requests: tighten qualification and require a paid deep-dive.
- Bad leads from cold outreach: keep volume low and personalized.

Templates appendix (copy-paste friendly)
- See sections above (LinkedIn connect, follow-up, cold email, audit hero copy).

Immediate next steps (first two weeks)
1. Pick 1 vertical and list 50 target companies (by end of Day 2).
2. Create 3 one-page case sheets from portfolio projects (Day 3–5). Use Canva.
3. Build a short audit landing page (single page) with Calendly link (Day 6–10).
4. Post 3 LinkedIn value posts and start daily outreach (Day 7 onward).
5. Run first micro-workshop or webinar by Week 2–3.

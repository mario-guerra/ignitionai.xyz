# Email Automation Demo Script - Legal Practice Lead Management


---

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Hello, I'm Mario with IgnitionAI, and I'm pleased to show you our email automation solution designed specifically for legal practices. What I'm about to demonstrate solves a critical problem that many law firms face - leads falling through the cracks due to delayed responses or manual follow-up processes.

Today, I'll walk you through how our system automatically captures leads, engages them with intelligent questionnaires, and ensures no potential client goes unanswered. Let's dive in.

## Lead Capture Demo (45 seconds)

Here's our sample law firm website - Harborview Legal Group. When a potential client fills out our contact form, they select their legal need - whether it's probate, criminal defense, estate planning, or small business matters.

The moment they click submit, our automation springs into action. Behind the scenes, the system is processing this inquiry and immediately adding it to our lead management dashboard. No manual data entry required.

## Intelligent Response System (60 seconds)

Within minutes of form submission, the client receives a personalized email response. This isn't just a generic "thank you" message. The system automatically sends a tailored questionnaire based on their specific legal need, along with a direct link to schedule a consultation using our integrated Calendly system.

This immediate response accomplishes three things: it shows professionalism, it gathers crucial case information upfront, and it gives clients the convenience of self-service scheduling. This means you're capturing detailed case information even before your first conversation.

## Dashboard Overview (60 seconds)

Now let's look at what you see as the attorney. This is your lead management dashboard - your command center for all incoming prospects.

Here's Emily Chen, who just contacted us about estate planning. The system shows me her status - she's responded to our questionnaire and has already scheduled an appointment for tomorrow at 2 PM. I can see at a glance exactly where each lead stands in the process.

## AI-Powered Insights (45 seconds)

Here's where it gets really powerful. When Emily responded to our questionnaire, our AI system automatically analyzed her responses and created this executive summary. Instead of reading through lengthy questionnaire responses, I get a concise overview of her needs: she's dealing with her father's estate, has specific concerns about tax implications, and needs guidance on probate proceedings.

If I need more detail, the full questionnaire responses are right here. But for quick case assessment and preparation, this AI summary is invaluable.

## Intelligent Follow-up System (60 seconds)

Now here's what sets our system apart from basic automation - intelligent follow-up. Let me show you Michael Rodriguez, who contacted us yesterday about probate matters.

Michael submitted his initial inquiry but hasn't yet responded to our questionnaire or scheduled his consultation. Our system automatically detected this and will send him a gentle follow-up reminder. But here's the intelligent part - it checks his engagement status first. If he had already scheduled a meeting but just hadn't completed the questionnaire, it would send a different message focused on that specific action.

This ensures we're never bombarding clients with irrelevant reminders, but we're also never letting genuine leads go cold simply because life got in the way.

## Business Impact (30 seconds)

Let me summarize what this means for your practice: No lead goes unanswered. Every inquiry gets an immediate, professional response. Clients can self-serve their scheduling, reducing phone tag. You get detailed case information before your first meeting. And our intelligent follow-up ensures interested prospects don't slip through the cracks.

## Closing (30 seconds)

This system handles the routine tasks that eat up your valuable time, while ensuring every potential client feels heard and attended to immediately. You focus on practicing law - we handle making sure you never miss an opportunity.

I'd love to discuss how we can customize this solution for your specific practice areas and workflow. What questions do you have about what you've seen today?

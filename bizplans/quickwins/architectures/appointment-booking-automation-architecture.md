# Appointment & Booking Automation — Architecture Spec

Purpose
- Automate booking flows, confirmations, reminders and rescheduling to reduce manual scheduling and no-shows.

Contract
- Inputs: booking request (via web form, phone agent, or email), provider availability calendar, business rules (buffer times, max bookings).
- Outputs: calendar event, confirmation message, reminder messages, cancellation handling.

Core components
1. Booking API
   - Public endpoint to receive booking requests with validation.
   - Enforces business rules: working hours, buffers, resource constraints.
2. Availability & Calendar Connector
   - Reads availability from Google Calendar / Office365 and writes events.
   - Optionally maintain cached availability for fast checks.
3. Confirmation & Reminder Engine
   - Sends email/SMS confirmation and scheduled reminders (24h, 1h or custom).
4. Intake Forms & Intake Data Store
   - Collects intake fields (name, phone, service, notes) and attaches to event.
5. Rescheduling / Cancellation Flow
   - Secure links in messages allow customers to reschedule/cancel; enforce policies.
6. Admin Dashboard
   - View bookings, override slots, set service durations and no-show policies.

Data model
- services(id, name, duration_minutes, buffer_before, buffer_after)
- bookings(id, customer_name, service_id, start_time, end_time, status, created_by)
- reminders(id, booking_id, when, channel, sent_at)

Sequence flow
1. Customer submits booking via web form or the AI call agent.
2. Booking API checks availability via Calendar Connector and reserves a tentative slot (transactional write or temporary hold).
3. On success, create calendar event and send confirmation SMS/email.
4. Schedule reminders using a job scheduler (e.g., cron, queue).
5. Customer can reschedule via secure link; system cancels original event and creates new one.

Integrations
- Calendars: Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph.
- SMS: Twilio or other SMS provider.
- Email: SendGrid, SES, or SMTP provider.
- Booking pages: hosted or embedded widget (React).

Infrastructure
- Stateless API (Node/Python) behind load balancer.
- DB: Postgres for bookings and services.
- Job queue: Redis + worker for reminders.
- Frontend: small React widget to embed on site.

Security
- Secure reschedule/cancel links using signed tokens with expiry.
- Validate calendar API tokens and use least-privilege scopes.
- Rate limit public endpoints.

Error handling & concurrency
- Use optimistic locking or calendar API transactional checks: if reservation fails, return clear error to user.
- Implement fallback when calendar API rate limited: show "try again" messaging.

Monitoring & metrics
- Booking success rate, no-show rate, average time-to-confirmation, reminder delivery rates.

Testing & acceptance
- Unit tests for availability checks and business rule enforcement.
- Integration tests with Google Calendar sandbox for create/read/delete events.
- Acceptance: booking round-trip completes within 3s, reminders delivered reliably, reschedule link works and expires correctly.

Developer tasks
1. Create service catalog and DB schema.
2. Implement Calendar Connector and booking API.
3. Build confirmation/reminder worker and message templates.
4. Implement frontend booking widget.
5. Add admin dashboard for overrides.

Estimated effort
- MVP: 2–3 weeks.
- Production: 5–8 weeks for multi-provider support and dashboards.

Notes
- Keep business rules configurable via admin UI to avoid code changes for small policy tweaks.
- Always test calendar writes in a sandbox tenant to avoid accidental bookings.

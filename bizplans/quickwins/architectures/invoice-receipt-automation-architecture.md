# Invoice & Receipt Automation — Architecture Spec

Purpose
- Automate extraction of invoice/receipt data, auto-match to payments, and trigger reminders to reduce manual accounting work and DSO.

Contract
- Inputs: invoice documents (PDF, JPG, email attachments), CSV bank statements, payment records from payment providers.
- Outputs: structured invoice records (vendor, date, line items, amount), match recommendations, reminder messages, reconciliation status.

Core components
1. Ingest & OCR
   - Document ingestion via email connector or upload UI.
   - OCR + PDF parsing (Tesseract, AWS Textract, Azure Form Recognizer) to extract text and table structures.
2. Extractor & Parser
   - Heuristics and ML models to map extracted text into structured fields: invoice number, date, vendor, total, tax, line items.
   - Confidence scoring per field.
3. Matching Engine
   - Rule-based and fuzzy matching against payments (bank CSVs, Stripe/PayPal) using dates, amounts, and invoice numbers.
4. Reconciliation Workflow
   - Auto-approve matches above confidence threshold; low-confidence matches go to human review queue.
   - Reminder engine for overdue invoices (email/SMS templates).
5. Accounting Integration
   - Export or sync to QuickBooks/Xero or provide CSV export for manual import.
6. Human Review UI
   - Interface for accountants to validate parsed fields and confirm matches.

Data model
- invoice_jobs(id, source, extracted_json, confidence, status)
- payments(id, source, amount, date, matched_invoice_id)
- matches(id, invoice_id, payment_id, score, status)
- reminders(id, invoice_id, attempt_count, last_sent)

Sequence flow
1. Ingest invoice(s) and store raw file.
2. OCR/parse job extracts fields and produces confidence scores per field.
3. Matching engine attempts to find payments; if confidence >= threshold, auto-match and mark reconciled.
4. If below threshold, create review task for staff.
5. On unresolved overdue, send reminder messages according to config and track attempts.

Integrations
- OCR: Azure Form Recognizer, AWS Textract, or open-source Tesseract + layout parser.
- Payment providers: Stripe, PayPal, bank CSV import.
- Accounting: QuickBooks API, Xero API, or CSV export.

Infrastructure
- Worker queue for OCR and parsing.
- DB: Postgres for job states and matches.
- Storage: Blob storage for raw documents.
- Frontend: React dashboard for review and reconciliation.

Security & compliance
- Financial data should be encrypted at rest; restrict access to accounting roles.
- Audit logs for edits and reconciliation actions.

Error handling
- Retry transient OCR/API failures; escalate persistent failures to DLQ.
- For ambiguous matches, surface top-N candidate payments to reviewer.

Monitoring & metrics
- Extraction accuracy rate, matching accuracy, time-to-reconcile, DSO improvements.
- Alert on backlog growth in review queue.

Testing & acceptance
- Unit: parser accuracy per field using labeled sample invoices.
- Integration: full flow from upload → parse → match using sample payments.
- Acceptance: target >90% accuracy for total amount extraction and >80% auto-match rate for standard invoices.

Developer tasks
1. Setup project skeleton and CI.
2. Implement ingestion and storage.
3. Integrate OCR provider and build extractor pipeline.
4. Implement matching algorithms and human review UI.
5. Add accounting connector and reminder engine.

Estimated effort
- MVP: 4–6 weeks.
- Production: 8–12 weeks (robust connectors, high-volume tuning).

Notes
- Start with a single OCR provider and limited vendor templates to improve accuracy quickly.
- Log raw OCR outputs to support rapid rule updates.

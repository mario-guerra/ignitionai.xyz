# FAQ & Support Bot (Smart Answers) — One-Page Quick Win

Who this helps
- Small teams where staff waste time searching for answers, and customers wait for responses.

Problem (in plain language)
- Your team spends time looking for procedures and answers. Customers create repeat tickets for the same questions.

What we deliver (simple outcome)
- A searchable, chat-style support assistant that answers common questions instantly using your documents and FAQs.

What you’ll get (deliverables)
- Small knowledge base built from your top 50 FAQs and key documents.
- Chat widget for your website and/or a Slack/Teams bot for internal use.
- Admin page to review answers and add edits.
- 1 training session (30–60 min) + 1-page admin guide.
- 30-day pilot with metrics tracking.

Pilot Package (recommended)
- Timeline: 2–4 weeks.
- Price: $1,500–$5,000 (pilot) depending on content size and channels.
- Goal: deflect support tickets and speed up staff responses.

Full Implementation
- Timeline: 4–8 weeks (advanced routing, analytics, CRM integration).
- Price: $3,500–$12,000 depending on scale and integrations.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) we measure
- Ticket deflection rate (% of queries handled automatically).
- Average time-to-answer for staff and customers.
- Reduction in support hours per week.
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT) for answered queries.

How it works — 3 simple steps
1. Content collection (1 week): we pull FAQs, docs, and recordings.
2. Pilot build (1–2 weeks): we create the knowledge base, tune answers, and deploy a chat channel.
3. Review & improve (week 3+): we monitor answers, add edits, and expand scope.

Data & privacy (plain terms)
- We index your documents for quick answers but do not share them externally.
- Option: host the knowledge base on your Azure account for extra control.

Integrations & requirements
- Common integrations: Zendesk, HubSpot, Intercom, Slack, Microsoft Teams.
- Access needed: sample docs, FAQs, and optionally a test account for your support tool.

Common questions (short answers)
- Can the bot escalate? Yes — it can create a ticket or route queries to a human.
- Does it replace staff? No — it handles repeatable queries and frees staff for complex work.
- Is it truth-safe? We surface sources and provide an "I’m not sure" fallback to avoid hallucinations.

Risk reduction & guarantee
- Pilot includes human review controls and KPIs.
- If pilot KPIs aren’t met, we provide a scoped discount for rework.

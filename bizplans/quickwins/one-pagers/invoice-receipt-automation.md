- Number of reminders sent and payment resolution rate.

How it works — 3 simple steps
1. Kickoff & sample collection (3–5 days): provide 20–50 invoices for tuning.
2. Pilot deployment (1–3 weeks): set up extraction rules and reminders.
3. Review & expand (week 3+): analyze results, tweak rules, and integrate with accounting systems.

Data & privacy (plain terms)
- Sensitive financial data is handled securely. We can run extraction in your environment or with strict retention policies.
- Option: run on your Azure tenant for enterprise-level controls.

Integrations & requirements
- Common integrations: QuickBooks, Xero, Stripe, bank CSVs.
- Access needed: sample invoices, read access to accounting system or CSV exports.

Common questions (short answers)
- What about unusual invoice formats? We tune extraction rules and fallback to a human review step.
- Can we keep human oversight? Yes — approvals can be required before final entry.
- How accurate is extraction? Pilot includes accuracy tuning with target thresholds.

Risk reduction & guarantee
- Pilot includes accuracy targets and human-in-the-loop review.
- If pilot targets aren’t met we offer scoped rework or a discount.

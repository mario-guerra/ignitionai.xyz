# Email & Lead Triage Automation — One-Page Quick Win

Who this helps
- Small business owners and operations teams who lose leads or spend hours triaging inboxes.

Problem (in plain language)
- Important customer emails and new leads get buried. Slow responses cost opportunities and time.

What we deliver (simple outcome)
- Fast, accurate inbox triage that suggests replies, prioritizes leads, and routes messages to the right person — so you respond faster and win more business.

What you’ll get (deliverables)
- Configured triage flow for your primary inbox (Gmail or Outlook).
- 5–10 ready-to-use reply templates tailored to your tone.
- Auto-priority rules (e.g., VIP customers, high-value keywords).
- 1 training session (30–60 min) and a 1-page user guide.
- 14-day pilot with measurable KPIs.

Pilot Package (low-risk entry)
- Timeline: 1–2 weeks.
- Price: $750–$2,000 (pilot). Includes setup, templates, and training.
- Goal: reduce average first-response time and increase lead-to-meeting conversions.

Full Implementation
- Timeline: 2–4 weeks (if expanding to multiple mailboxes or CRM integration).
- Price: $2,000–$6,000 depending on scale and integrations.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) we measure
- Average first response time (hours → minutes).
- Leads contacted within 24 hours (%).
- Lead-to-meeting conversion rate (% change).
- Hours saved per week (team-wide).

How it works — 3 simple steps
1. Quick audit (30–60 min): we review your inbox workflows and goals.
2. Pilot setup (1 week): we configure rules, templates, and a safe review loop so you can approve suggestions before sending.
3. Review & scale (week 2+): we measure KPIs, tweak rules, and optionally connect to your CRM.

Data & privacy (plain terms)
- We keep your data private: pilot runs with your account; suggestions are generated in real-time and are not retained beyond the pilot unless you opt in.
- Option: run on your Azure tenant or under an agreed data-handling policy for sensitive industries.

Integrations & requirements
- Works with Gmail, Outlook, and common CRMs (QuickBooks/HubSpot/Zoho) via standard connectors.
- Access needed: a readonly mailbox view and optionally API access to CRM for routing.

Common questions (short answers)
- What if the automation makes a mistake? You stay in control: suggestions require approval in the pilot.
- Will this change my voice to customers? No — templates are written in your tone and reviewed by you.
- What if I don’t see improvements? We include KPI targets for the pilot and offer a discount if agreed KPIs aren’t met.

Risk reduction & guarantee
- Low-cost pilot with clear KPIs.
- 7–14 day refund or discount if agreed pilot metrics are not reached (details in pilot agreement).

# AI Call Agent — One-Page Quick Win (Med Spa)

Who this helps
- Small service businesses (med spas, clinics, salons) that miss calls and lose bookings because staff can’t answer every call.

Problem (plain language)
- Calls come in after hours or during busy periods. Voicemail means missed bookings and lost revenue.
- Example: 14 calls in a day, 8 to voicemail → 8 missed opportunities.

Simple outcome
- An AI call agent answers instantly, qualifies callers, books appointments, and sends confirmations — reducing missed calls and increasing bookings without hiring more staff.

What you’ll get (deliverables)
- AI call agent configured for one phone number (forwarding or direct SIP). 
- Call flow: greet → qualify (service, preferred time) → check availability → book into your calendar.
- SMS/email confirmation + reminder workflow (24–48 hrs + 1 hr before). 
- Fallback rules and human handoff for complex requests.
- 30-minute onboarding and 1-page operator guide.

Pilot package (low friction)
- Scope: Off-hours + overflow handling for one number (or one location).
- Timeline: 7–14 days (setup, tuning, live pilot).
- Price: $500–$1,500 pilot (includes minutes/SMS up to agreed cap). 
- Safe mode: suggestions only or “whisper” mode where staff review bookings before confirmation.
- Guarantee: agreed KPI targets or a scoped credit for rework.

Full implementation
- Timeline: 2–4 weeks for multi-line or multi-location rollout and CRM integration.
- Price: $2,000–$7,000 depending on scale, SMS volume, and integrations.

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Missed calls/day (before vs after). 
- Appointments booked via AI per day/week.
- Lead → booking conversion rate.
- Incremental revenue from recovered bookings (Avg appointment value × bookings recovered).
- No-show rate with reminders enabled.

How it works — 3 simple steps
1. Quick audit (15–30 min): we review call volume, busiest times, average appointment value.
2. Pilot setup (3–7 days): configure call flow, calendar integration, and message templates.
3. Review & scale (week 2+): measure KPIs, tune voice prompts, expand coverage.

Integrations & tech (plain terms)
- Works with phone forwarding, Twilio, common SIP providers, Google Calendar, Outlook/Office365, and many booking systems.
- SMS delivered via provider of your choice; we can use your account or ours for pilot.

Privacy & compliance (what owners ask)
- Recordings & data: configurable retention. We can disable recordings or limit storage.
- HIPAA: we offer HIPAA-ready setups and will sign a BAA if the business handles PHI.
- Consent: the agent announces recording if required and asks for consent when needed.

Common objections — short answers
- “Will AI mess up bookings?” — Pilot starts in review mode; full auto only after you sign off.
- “What if callers need human help?” — The agent routes complex queries to staff or schedules callbacks.
- “Is it expensive?” — Pilots start at $500 and pay for themselves when even a few extra bookings are recovered.

Short demo script for the agent (voice)
- Agent: “Hi, you’ve reached [Business Name]. I can help you book, cancel, or learn about our services. Which would you like?”
- Caller: "Book an appointment."
- Agent: “Great — which service are you interested in: consultation, Botox, or filler?”
- Agent: “I have availability Wednesday at 3pm or Friday at 11am. Which works better?”
- Agent: “All set — I’ve booked you for Wednesday at 3pm. You’ll get a confirmation text and a reminder 24 hours before.”

ROI snapshot (one-line math)
- Example: 3 recovered bookings/week × $150 avg value = $450/week → ~$1,800/month.
